# Taming Data Drift: ML Model Maintenance Strategies

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a project on monitoring, identifying, and mitigating Model and Data Drift in Machine Learning projects. It provides practical strategies to keep your ML models performing well in production environments.

## Project Structure

The project consists of five Python scripts demonstrating different aspects of handling Data Drift:

1. `datadrift_1.py`: Initial model creation, training, and evaluation
2. `datadrift_2.py`: Data Drift simulation and model evaluation
3. `datadrift_3.py`: Mitigation strategy 1 - Retrain with new data and optimize hyperparameters
4. `datadrift_4.py`: Mitigation strategy 2 - Change algorithm (Gradient Boosting)
5. `datadrift_5.py`: Mitigation strategy 3 - Combine different algorithms (Ensemble method)

## Key Concepts Covered

- Understanding Model Drift and Data Drift
- Simulating Data Drift for testing purposes
- Strategies for mitigating the effects of Data Drift
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Ensemble methods for improved model performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the scripts in order: `python datadrift_1.py`, `python datadrift_2.py`, etc.

## Results

The project demonstrates the challenges of maintaining ML model performance in the face of Data Drift. It shows that sometimes, despite various mitigation strategies, the best solution may be to revisit the entire modeling process.
